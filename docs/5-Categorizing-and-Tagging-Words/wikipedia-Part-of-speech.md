词性

In [traditional grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_grammar), a **part of speech** (abbreviated form: **PoS** or **POS**) is a category of words (or, more generally, of [lexical items](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_item)) that have similar [grammatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar) properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar [syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) behavior—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes similar [morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)) in that they undergo [inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection) for similar properties.

Commonly listed [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) parts of speech are [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun), [verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb), [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective), [adverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb), [pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun), [preposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition), [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(grammar)), [interjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interjection), and sometimes [numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_(linguistics)), [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar)), or [determiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner). Other [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) also have essentially all these word classes;[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#cite_note-1) one exception to this generalization is that most [Slavic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages) as well as [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) and [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) do not have articles. Beyond the Indo-European family, such other European languages as [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language)and [Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language), both of which belong to the [Uralic family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralic_languages), completely lack prepositions or have only very few of them; rather, they have [postpositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postposition).

Other terms than *part of speech*—particularly in modern [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) classifications, which often make more precise distinctions than the traditional scheme does—include **word class**, **lexical class**, and **lexical category**. Some authors restrict the term *lexical category* to refer only to a particular type of [syntactic category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_category); for them the term excludes those parts of speech that are considered to be [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word), such as pronouns. The term **form class** is also used, although this has various conflicting definitions.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#cite_note-2) Word classes may be classified as [open or closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#Open_and_closed_classes): *open classes* (like nouns, verbs and adjectives) acquire new members constantly, while *closed classes* (such as pronouns and conjunctions) acquire new members infrequently, if at all.

Almost all languages have the word classes noun and verb, but beyond these two there are significant variations among different languages.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#cite_note-Kroeger_2005_35-3) For example,



Because of such variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties, analysis of parts of speech must be done for each individual language. Nevertheless, the labels for each category are assigned on the basis of universal criteria.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech#cite_note-Kroeger_2005_35-3)
